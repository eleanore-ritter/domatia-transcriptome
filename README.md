This paper investigated the molecular genetic basis of mite domatia and intraspecific variation in domatia size in *Vitis riparia* by quantifying domatia traits, analyzing differences in leaf shapes, and preforming RNA sequencing on two genotypes with distinct domatia sizes.

#### Within scripts, there are the following subdirectories:

* **1. phenotype_analyses:** scripts for statistics and plotting of phenotype data, including domatia measurements and leaf landmark data
* **2. gene_expression:** scripts for prepping RNA-seq reads and mapping them to the *V. riparia* genome with STAR
* **3. differential_expression:** scripts for performing differential expression analysis with DESeq2 and plotting the results
* **4. gene_functions:** scripts for identifying Arabidopsis orthologs of *V. riparia* genes
* **5. misc:** miscellaneous scripts
