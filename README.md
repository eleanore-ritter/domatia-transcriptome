**This Github repository contains scripts used in the paper titled "Small, but mitey: Investigating the molecular genetic basis for domatia development and intraspecific variation in Vitis riparia using transcriptomics".** 


#### The scripts are organized within the following subdirectories:

* **phenotype_analyses:** scripts for statistics and plotting of phenotype data, including domatia measurements and leaf landmark data
* **gene_expression:** scripts for prepping RNA-seq reads and mapping them to the *V. riparia* genome with STAR
* **differential_expression:** scripts for performing differential expression analysis with DESeq2 and plotting the results
* **gene_functions:** scripts for identifying Arabidopsis orthologs of *V. riparia* genes
* **misc:** miscellaneous scripts
